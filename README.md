# Boox - Desktop Floating Area Management Tool

Boox is a Qt-based desktop floating area management tool that allows you to create multiple floating windows on the Windows desktop, with each window mapping to a specific folder in a designated directory.

## Features

- ✅ **Directory Mapping**: Automatically scans the `d:\boox` directory and creates a corresponding floating area for each top-level folder.
- ✅ **Translucent Design**: Elegant translucent floating windows that blend perfectly with the desktop environment.
- ✅ **Grid View**: Files and folders are displayed in an icon grid, making them both aesthetic and easy to use.
- ✅ **Adaptive Width**: Window width automatically adjusts based on the length of the folder name.
- ✅ **Floating Windows**: Draggable and resizable floating windows that stay on top of the desktop layer.
- ✅ **File Management**: Supports dragging and dropping files into floating areas and opening files with a double-click.
- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatically monitors changes in the `d:\boox` directory, creating or deleting floating areas in real-time.
- ✅ **System Tray**: Minimizes to the system tray with support for quick operations.
- ⚙️ **Cross-platform**: Compiled with CMake, supports Windows (Linux support is in development).
